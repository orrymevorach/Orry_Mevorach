            The Casa Horizon website is a freelance project I collaborated on
            with the hostel owner and a freelance designer. The goal of the
            project was to build an attractive website that makes it easy for
            potential guests to see the rooms and attractions of the hostel, and
            to make a booking.

            I have been working full time on the Shoppers Drug Mart e-commerce

            Breadbox Bakery was a small business that delivered Challah bread to
            Jewish families on Friday evenings for Shabbat dinners with their
            families. I collaborated with the owner who had a distinct vision
            for the design and functionality of the website.

            Wrepit is a company still in the early stages, that will aim to
